We come from different backgrounds and industries but share the same deep vision of what Akua needed.\nI left a link to his LinkedIn, but to make a very short (and somewhat unfair) summary, Ger comes from a background that spans from the lowest levels of infrastructure all the way to building the team and platform at Sate (for friends), or Satellogic if we’re being formal.\nAs for me, I started my career as a product developer, and already during my time at Viacom (Telefé) I developed a strong curiosity for infrastructure. At Pomelo I had the opportunity to work full-time helping to build the IDP, and at Akua, together with “my buddy,” we designed and executed it from scratch — something I’m incredibly proud of.","building-the-foundations#Building the Foundations":"We partnered with Binbash to execute our PCI-compliant network design while Ger and I evaluated which tool would best fit our infrastructure management needs for the IDP. To be fully transparent, we analyzed three options. We discarded one right away, and with the remaining two, we ran quick proof-of-concepts to decide which one to keep.\nThe three tools we evaluated were:\nTerraform CDK — we ruled this one out from day zero. Why? Terraform was heading in a non–open-source direction, and at that time the Terraform CDK project lacked solid documentation — something that both Ger and I can’t stand due to how we work.\nCrossplane — it’s tempting to use, but the moment you need to add any logic to a product your platform provides, you’re in trouble. And let’s be honest — YAML is far too fragile to entrust it with managing your platform’s products.\nPulumi — as you might’ve guessed, this was our choice. It gave us the flexibility to implement any logic we wanted, abstracted away state management complexity, had excellent documentation, and a strong community adoption. That last point was key — it meant that if we grew the team in the future, new members wouldn’t face something completely unfamiliar. Finally, and importantly, Pulumi allows the implementation of dynamic resources — meaning if a resource isn’t natively supported, you can implement the Pulumi interface and manage it yourself. In our case (if I remember correctly), we did this twice: once for Typesense and once for New Relic deployment markers.\nTo clarify — neither Ger nor I had used Pulumi in production before. We knew and had tested it, but hadn’t used it at scale yet.\nOnce we chose our backend tool, we moved to the next phase: defining the presentation layer of our IDP.\nAs the title of this post suggests, this was where we debated from our differences. Ger, coming from highly technical teams with a need for total control, proposed that we expose the platform’s abstractions and have developers use them directly in their projects — meaning they’d need to know how to handle Pulumi. My perspective was that Akua’s developers wouldn’t feel comfortable dealing with platform tooling — instead, we should provide a presentation layer (a portal) from which they could design their project’s architecture, deploy it, and manage it.\nJust like with our backend choice, two major options appeared here: Backstage and Port.io. There are others, of course, but we always aim for tools with strong industry adoption — so that anyone joining later doesn’t find something obscure.\nIn this case, we chose Port.io. Why? Backstage would’ve forced us to build components on top of it — and at that moment, we didn’t want to touch any frontend work. It’s not our strength, and doing so would have meant significant time diversion we couldn’t afford.\nPort.io wasn’t a fallback — quite the opposite. I like to describe Port as the Notion of platforms. Its Blueprints system lets you design your platform around your needs, not the other way around. The UI is elegant, supports SSO, offers RBAC (still improving), and includes features like Scorecards, Self-Service Actions, Automations, and dashboards that can be created in just a few clicks — making it the perfect choice for our platform’s presentation layer.","conclusions#Conclusions":"There’s still a lot more to cover — how we implemented scorecards, day-2 actions, or single-tenant deployments — but I’ll save that for another post.\nTo wrap up, I want to reflect on a few points.\nAs I mentioned, we didn’t always agree on everything. But we managed to build an internal developer platform from our differences, always respecting each other’s opinions. We created a workflow that led us to build solid, future-proof solutions, and to be honest — were all the ideas Ger’s? Were they mine? Not at all. As I said, we built a process where we designed, evaluated multiple alternatives and cases, and then implemented. At the end of the day, it’s truly a team effort — what matters most is our platform and the people behind it.\nDear Ger — thank you deeply for your generosity and openness in teaching me so much. I hope I’ve left my mark on you too. It’s an honor and a real pleasure to have built this platform together — and, most importantly, the friendship we’ve built along the way. That’s for life.\nUntil next time 👋🏽","security--auth-and-authz#Security — Auth and Authz?":"From day zero, we’ve used IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) with tag-based permissions (I’ll mention our tagging strategy shortly). If a given AWS resource doesn’t support tags (like S3), our infra-lib can self-discover the resource and assign the required permissions automatically.\nSpeaking of tags — in a previous post someone criticized that “a platform without FinOps can’t be called a real platform.” Well, since day one, every single infrastructure resource we create includes centralized tagging managed by our infra-lib. This will allow us to easily implement billing for our IDP in the future. As a side note: our infrastructure costs are much lower than we predicted, thanks to correct per-environment configuration in our infra-lib.\nContinuing on the security topic — access to resources like databases is managed via security group rules between apps and DBs. Likewise, traffic between applications is blocked at the network level, even within the same namespace. This allows us to establish service-to-service access policies managed by Kong, which can be configured easily from our Port.io portal.","technology-stack#Technology Stack":"We developed a custom Helm chart for our applications. Over time, it evolved — now it supports deploying either a microservice or a monorepo, meaning a single project can deploy multiple Kubernetes services without needing separate GitLab projects.\nOur Helm chart (as designed from day zero) is unique, follows semver, and product developers can choose any version they need depending on the functionality required.\nAgain, our philosophy here was to centralize tooling and evolution, avoiding cognitive load on our internal customers. So, the Helm chart is shared — each project defines its own values.yaml, which is used at deployment time for the specific application(s).\nFor our CI/CD and application lifecycle management, we use GitLab. Ger’s deep experience here was invaluable — we run private runners that synchronize application resources without needing AWS credentials distributed in GitLab (which would be a major security risk).\nSpeaking of GitLab, we also know from experience how challenging it is to propagate pipeline changes across projects. That’s why we use centralized pipelines, where projects simply include them — they don’t need to worry about anything else. When something new is needed, it’s added to the central pipeline and immediately available to everyone. As always, versioned with semver to ensure safe evolution.\nAs I might have mentioned, our application workloads run on Kubernetes — specifically EKS on Fargate. This was Ger’s proposal, and thankfully, we were able to convince everyone necessary to go down that path.\nThe advantages? Minimal Kubernetes operations, trivial upgrades, PCI compliance, and more.\nOf course, there are tradeoffs — you can’t deploy DaemonSets, for example. But that doesn’t worry us too much because (returning to our mantra of simplicity), our EKS clusters have very few installed components:\nKong Metrics Server External DNS And yes — there must be a very strong justification and benefit to install anything else.","the-first-days-and-first-steps#The First Days and First Steps":"We started with a blank sheet — literally. There was absolutely nothing at Akua. Just an empty AWS account, but that was the least of our worries. Here’s a short list of our “mantras,” which we still uphold and make sure remain true to this day:\nThe operation and maintenance of our platform must tend to zero. Whatever we develop must be testable locally — and it shouldn’t be a pain to do so. If it works in development, it must work in production (or any other environment). Everything should be self-discoverable — no hardcoding. Simplicity above all. Break the inertia of past experiences.","wait--what-about-secrets#Wait — what about secrets?":"We developed a workflow using Parameter Store, which allows us to deploy and make secrets available to applications flexibly. If a secret isn’t managed by our infra-lib, the security team can add it to Parameter Store and it automatically becomes available to the apps."},"title":"Building from Differences"},"/blog/posts/career/":{"data":{"":"Anniversaries, be it a birthday, the end of the year or whatever, generally lead one to reflect.\nThis case would not be the exception, what is the anniversary, less than a month ago i completed one year in my current company (Pomelo), August 29, 2022 the promotions in the company were made public, I am part of the people who were promoted, I wanted to write some conclusions that I have drawn from these 365 days, two teams and a promotion.","beginnings#Beginnings":"My first approach to Pomelo was through Maru, we already knew each other, Maru was the one who did the hiring process when I joined MercadoLibre, then we were close to meet again in Naranja X, but the impasse served well to meet again professionally in Pomelo, I tell this precisely because of the term of trust.\nDo you think Maru would have trusted me not just once, but twice, I don’t think so, she is an absolutely admirable person in building technology teams, and that trust we have in each other makes her trust me again and again and call me back:\nMaru trusts me again and again and calls me back.

In the Go ecosystem sometimes we complex some patterns and fall into “anti patterns”, in the next post we will review a fake project and refactor it to make good use of the interfaces.\nTo simplify the publication a bit, we will narrow down the use case and reduce it to the service and repository layer.\nLet’s imagine that in the repository layer we find the following:\npackage repository import ( // pkg imports ) type Repository interface { Save(ctx context.Context, model *beer.Beer) (*beer.Beer, error) } type repository struct { // repository client and configs go here } func NewRepository() Repository { return \u0026repository{} } func (repo *repository) Save(ctx context.Context, model *beer.Beer) (*beer.Beer, error) { // previous logic here return

beer, err := svc.repo.Save(ctx, model) if err != nil { return nil, err } return beer, err } The above scenario is the one I commonly encounter in Go projects and I want to tell you that I also made the same mistake.\nAll good luispi, but what’s the mistake?\nGo interfaces generally belong to the package that uses values of the interface type, not to the package that implements those values.

NewRepository() function returns the Repository structure, and second we add to Repository the save method.\nAll well and good luispi, but what do we gain with this change?\nSince we do not have to comply with any interface contract we are not tied to having to implement all the methods that the interface has.\nWe have to think of this package as a producer (producer) and always keep in mind that producers, again, return concrete types (usually a pointer or a structure).\nNow it is the turn to edit the consumer layer, in this case the service.\npackage service import ( // pkg imports ) type Repository interface { Save(ctx context.Context, beer *Beer) (*Beer, error) } type Service struct { repo Repository } func NewService(repo Repository) Service { return Service{repo: repo} } func (svc *Service) Create(ctx context.Context, beer *Beer) (*Beer, error) { createBeer, err := svc.repo.Save(ctx, beer) if err != nil { return nil, err } return createBeer, err } Let’s review the change.\nWe make several changes, first we declare the Repository interface and in the Service structure we inject the interface so that it can be consumed in the service methods.\nAs with the

Then in the second and final stage with the following line COPY --from=builder /build/myapp /myapp we copy the binary from the stage that we have selected as builder and we make it available in an alpine image.\nIf we list now our images we can see that it weighs approximately 9 MB, yes yes, I wrote correctly 9 megabytes 😎.\nWe could do one last optimization or best practice, but I think it’s worth leaving it for another post.\nSo as not to bore you and for the moment let’s take a break.\nHave a good time! 👋🏽"},"title":"Size matters"},"/blog/posts/mistakes-and-learnings/":{"data":{"":"In our society in general and in technology in particular, we have the strange habit of publishing success stories (opinion of the writer, wrongly called successful case) and few, if any, occasions where mistakes are shared (opinion of the writer, wrongly called failure).\nAs you might be suspecting below I am going to share some mistakes, which I learned from them and even more how much I grew and understood about the industry by sharing them.","lesson-1#Lesson 1:":"Write a step-by-step, share it, validate and re-validate it before executing anything\nMy first productive development was in 2012 (?) approximately, it was a website for a company that needed to publish its product catalog, I list technologies to have some context:\ndigitalocean, just released, in addition to the droplets, I don’t know how many more products I had in my portfolio angular js (angular 1) I think nodeJS for the backend This development was done with one of the people I respect and admire the most, Victor De Grandis -Vitor-.\nMy experience configuring servers was null, I had the delirious idea of telling Vitor:\n_my friend, can I set up the server, and then you try to break it?\nThen I started to make several configurations, among them, I started to play with the ports, until I proudly told him:\nVitor, try to see what happens.\nAfter a while I receive a message,\nmy friend, could it be that you closed port 22?\nBeautiful, I left the house, locked the door and threw the key into a pond.\nAs the digitalocean people are prepared for people like this writer, they have a feature that if accessed from the web (I have no idea how to solve it from behind) you can run a terminal in the browser and access the droplet.\nI reconfigured the ports, and the rest is history.","lesson-2#Lesson 2:":"Document knowledge, no matter how trivial we consider it, and invite others to do the same.

In context of documentation: it is extremely difficult to add functionality because the lack of documentation causes us to waste an enormous amount of time trying to understand how things are built.

What’s absolutely wrong is managing infrastructure and platform operations through tickets.\nSo what does the “hammer” metaphor have to do with this?\nIt means that many companies misapplied agile methodologies to their infrastructure teams. It’s time to pause and reflect on why things aren’t working well in so many places.\nHow can we avoid it?\nWe must inject a product mindset into infrastructure teams — offering high-quality abstractions and user experiences over the underlying platform chaos, enabling product engineering teams to become self-sufficient in managing their software and its infrastructure.\nI hope my experience helps you rethink how to build culture and work processes for infrastructure teams within your company.\nIf you have questions or want to discuss any of this, I’d love to connect.\nSee you soon! 👋🏽","position#Position":"What’s the rationale behind such a strong stance?\nYou need an extremely strong culture from end to end to decide which ticket is more important than another.

Innovation is impossible in a ticket-driven infrastructure model.

Let’s encourage the ability to solve problems, not everything in life has a solution and there are no answers for everything.\nLet’s encourage the ability to solve problems, not everything in life has a solution and there are no answers for everything.\nFinally, in many companies it is common to encounter performance review processes twice a year and I would like to leave a question in the air.\nDo we really believe that a person can make an evolution within six months?\nAnd here the fragment of Paenza’s talk makes more sense.\nThere should be no other year in a person’s life where one incorporates so much information, learns so much, changes so much in quality of life, as from 0 to 1 year of age.","the-obvious-not-everything-has-to-go-through-you-nor-do-you-have-to-be-aware-of-everything#The obvious, not everything has to go through you, nor do you have to be aware of everything":"How many times have you crossed paths with “toxic leaders”, What is toxic for me?\nThose people who are funnel, everything has to go through them, all the time they need different decisions to go through them and almost 100% of the time their decisions predominate.\nWhat do I propose?\nLet’s promote and accompany the growth of the people in the team and the team, let’s share knowledge and be open to new ideas and proposals.\nPersonally speaking the day I went on vacation and everything followed its course, we even took out functionalities, we communicated them and when you come back you don’t have that feeling of FOMO it’s the glory.\nI leave the question in the context of when you come back or someone comes back from vacation and you hear it daily.\nUff I’ve been going through all the emails and slack messages to catch up\nShouldn’t projects take their natural course without you being present?","the-quest-for-quick-feedback-to-feel-valuable#The quest for quick feedback to feel valuable":"One of the things I would have loved to have been advised on when I started managing and leading teams is to look for things that give me a quick return of dopamine.\nWhen you are leading and managing teams, change processes are very slow and you tend to think that you are useless and that you are not doing “anything productive”, calm down.\nI don’t like tips and tricks, but something that helped me and that I would have liked to be advised is to look for what makes you happy, write a piece of code or refactor, document, anything, but something that makes you feel that you are contributing value to the team, again, already leading and making decisions bring a brutal value, the problem is that it is imperceptible and one is human and needs to feel useful and valuable."},"title":"We should all manage teams"},"/blog/posts/when-the-context-matter/":{"data":{"":"The following publication could be said to be a continuation of another one where we talk about how having lightweight images helps us in many aspects, if you still could not read it here I leave you the access.\nToday we are going to make a small, but important improvement, and we are going to find out why we are doing it.","preface#Preface":"As the last proposal in the post I shared earlier we stayed at this point:\nDockerfile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 #
